*NAME: SHAIK KARISHMA  
*INTERN ID: OPT/CS/2858 
*DOMAIN: JAVA PROGRAMMING 
*DURATION: 4 WEEKS (15th May 2025 -15thJune 2025)
*TASK-TASK-1 (LEVEL-2)

## Project Overview
This *ATM Interface* project is a simple console-based application developed using Java. It simulates the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), allowing users to authenticate themselves using a user ID and PIN, and then perform common banking functions such as balance inquiry, withdrawal, deposit, and viewing transaction history.

The project is structured with clarity and simplicity in mind, making it an excellent foundational task for anyone learning Java. It incorporates key programming constructs such as conditionals, loops, user input handling, and list data structures for transaction history tracking. Despite being a simulation, it captures the real-world flow of an ATM session effectively.

## Features

- *User Authentication*: Before accessing the ATM features, the user must enter a valid user ID and PIN combination.
- *Balance Inquiry*: Displays the current account balance.
- *Cash Withdrawal*: Allows the user to withdraw an amount, with balance validation and user confirmation.
- *Deposit*: Enables the user to deposit an amount into the account.
- *Transaction History*: Maintains a record of deposits and withdrawals which the user can view at any time.
- *Exit Option*: Cleanly exits the system when the user selects the quit option.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- *Java Programming Language*: All logic has been written in Java, one of the most widely used and beginner-friendly programming languages.
- *JDK (Java Development Kit)*: Used to compile and run the application locally.
- *Scanner Class*: Used for reading user input from the console.
- *ArrayList*: Javaâ€™s built-in dynamic array structure is used for storing and displaying transaction history.
- *Text Editor / IDE*: This project can be developed using any text editor or Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.
- *Git & GitHub*: Version control is maintained using Git, and the project is hosted on GitHub for collaboration and showcasing purposes.

## How It Works

1. The application starts by greeting the user and prompting them to enter their user ID and PIN.
2. On successful login (user ID: user123, PIN: 123), the user is presented with a menu of operations:
   - View available balance
   - Withdraw money
   - Deposit money
   - View transaction history
   - Exit the system
3. For withdrawal, the application checks if the requested amount is less than or equal to the available balance. If so, it asks for confirmation before deducting the amount.
4. Deposits are validated to ensure they are greater than zero before being added to the balance.
5. Every successful withdrawal or deposit is logged in the transaction history, which can be viewed at any time during the session.
6. The application loops continuously until the user selects the exit option, at which point it displays a thank-you message and terminates.

## Applicability

This ATM Interface simulation, while basic, has several real-world learning applications:

- *Educational Use*: Ideal for beginners learning Java, helping them understand how to use data types, conditionals, loops, input/output, and arrays or lists.
- *Logic Building*: Helps in building logic flow, validating user input, and structuring decision-making in software applications.
- *Mini-Project for Portfolio*: This project can be showcased in coding portfolios to demonstrate understanding of basic programming concepts.
- *Interview Preparation*: Similar patterns and logic-based questions are often asked during technical interviews for entry-level roles.
- *Banking System Simulation*: Serves as a conceptual foundation to develop more complex banking systems using GUI, databases, or web interfaces in the future.

## Learning Outcomes

Working on this ATM Interface project has helped in understanding the following:

- Implementation of conditional checks and loops in Java
- Using the Scanner class for interactive console input
- Managing state (like balance and transaction records) throughout the session
- Designing a user-friendly menu-driven interface
- Structuring code into manageable and logical sections
- The importance of validating inputs and providing feedback to users

## Conclusion

The *ATM Interface* project serves as a strong starting point for learning the fundamentals of software development using Java. It captures the basic operations one would perform at an ATM and translates them into code with logic that mirrors real-world behavior. It has improved my understanding of control structures, user authentication, data storage using collections, and interactive application development. I look forward to extending this application in the future by integrating features like multiple user support, persistent data storage using files or databases, and possibly a graphical interface for better usability.
